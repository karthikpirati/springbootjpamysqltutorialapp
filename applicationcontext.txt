Spring ApplicationContext
ApplicationContext is a corner stone of a Spring Boot application. 
It represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for 
instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. 
The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and 
assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code.

ApplicationContext provides the following:

Bean factory methods for accessing application components
The ability to load file resources in a generic way
The ability to publish events to registered listeners
The ability to resolve messages, supporting internationalization



To access the application context, we can autowire the ApplicationContext interface or implement the ApplicationContextAware.
