Core Container

This container has the following four modules :

Spring Core: This module is the core of the Spring Framework. 
It provides implementation for features like  IoC (Inversion of Control) and Dependency Injection with singleton design pattern.
Spring Bean: This module provides implementation for the factory design pattern through BeanFactory.
Spring Context: This module is built on the solid base provided by the Core and the Beans modules 
and is a medium to access any object defined and configured.


Spring Data Access/ Integration

It consists of the following five modules:

JDBC: This module provides JDBC abstraction layer which eliminates the need of repetitive and unnecessary exception handling overhead.
ORM: ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. This module provides consistency/ portability to our code regardless 
of data access technologies based on object oriented mapping concept.
OXM: OXM stands for Object XML Mappers. It is used to convert the objects into XML format and vice versa. 
The Spring OXM provides an uniform API to access any of these OXM frameworks.
JMS: JMS stands for Java Messaging Service. This module contains features for producing and consuming messages 
among various clients.
Transaction: This module supports programmatic and declarative transaction management for classes that implement special interfaces and for all your POJOs. 
All the enterprise level transaction implementation concepts can be implemented in Spring by using this module.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring is famous for dependency injection :

Instead of we creating object by new keyword.Spring Container will take care of creating objects.
Because if we create the object by using new object it will be tightly coupled.
It will be very difficult to maintain.


spring IOC container  :

Spring IoC stands for Inversion of Control. 
It is the heart of the Spring Framework. 
The important tasks performed by the IoC container are:

Create the bean
Instantiating the bean
Wiring the beans together
Configuring the beans
Managing the bean’s entire life-cycle


The IoC container receives metadata from either an XML file, Java annotations, or Java code and works accordingly.

IoC adds the flexibility and control of application, 
and provides a central place of configuration management for Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) of our application. 

There are two types of IoC containers:

BeanFactory
ApplicationContext


BeanFactory :

It is an interface defined in org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory.
Bean Factory provides the basic support for Dependency Injection.
It is based on factory design pattern which creates the beans of any type.(Shape example )
BeanFactory follows lazy-initialization technique which means beans are loaded as soon as bean factory instance 
is created but the beans are created only when getBean() method is called.


The XmlBeanFactory is the implementation class for the BeanFactory interface. 
To use the BeanFactory, you need to create the instance of XmlBeanFactory class as shown below: 
1
BeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml")

Object obj =beanFactory.getBean("helloWorld");
HelloWorld hw=(HelloWorld)obj;

beans.xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

   <bean id = "helloWorld" class = "com.tutorialspoint.HelloWorld">
      <property name = "message" value = "Hello World!"/>
   </bean>

</beans>

or

@Controller("conteoller bean name")

@Service("conteoller bean name")

@Controller("conteoller bean name")


ApplicationContext : 

It is an interface defined in org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext.
It is the advanced Spring container and is built on top of the BeanFactory interface.
ApplicationContext supports the features supported by Bean Factory but also provides some additional functionalities.
ApplicationContext follows eager-initialization technique which means instance of beans 
are created as soon as you create the instance of Application context.

The ClassPathXmlApplicationContext,AnnotationConfigApplicationContext are the classes 
that provide implementation of ApplicationContext interface. 

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext - will be used when we are working with xml to conmfigure beans
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext - will be used when we are working with annotations to configure beans

Currently internally spring boot uses AnnotationConfigApplicationContext as a class that provides 
implementation of ApplicationContext interface.

eg :
ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.getBean("id of the bean");

bean id will be configured via annotation @Service("id")

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
ctx.getBean(Region.class);


Differences :
1) BeanFactory follows lazy initialization where as ApplicationContext follows eager initialization
2) ApplicationContext built on top of Bean Factory and it provides more features like internalization 
which means working with multiple languages

Dependency Injection :

Here, you do not create the objects instead you just define how they should be created 
and IoC container will create the objects for you.


By default, Spring creates all singleton beans eagerly at the startup/bootstrapping of the application context.
The reason behind this is simple: to avoid and detect all possible errors immediately at server start rather than at runtime.

In Spring, dependencies can be injected in three ways:

By constructor

private Service service;
@Autowired
public Controller(Service service){
	this.service=service;
}

By setter method

private Service service;

public void setService(){
this.service=service;
}

By field injection:

@Autowired
private Service service;


Note : @Autowired will not create the object it will just sttores the reference of object that is created
if service is null which means Object is not created because you have not annotated with
@Controler or @Service or @Repository or @Component


if you find this ertror :

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, 
or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

when bean is having multiple implementation and if we are injecting this bean 
Spring will get confused about in

eg: we can send messages in many ways (email,watsapp,twitter)

//MessagingService
public interface MessagingService {
	
	public void sendMessage(String message);

}

There are multiple implementaion classes to this interface :

@Service("email")
public class EmailService implements MessagingService{

	@Override
	public void sendMessage(String message)  {
		System.out.println("sending message through email");
	}

}

@Service("watsapp")
public class WatsAppService implements MessagingService{

	@Override
	public void sendMessage(String message) {
		System.out.println("sending message through watsapp");
	}

}

Let say if you are trying to inject MessagingService dependency inside controller ie will get confused
which depency to inject(beacuse we have muliple implementations EmailService & WatsAppService) 

To resolve the ambiquity use @Qualifier with id of bean to inject

@RestController
public class Controller{
	// qualifier decides which bean to inject (watsapp or email)
		@Qualifier("email")
		@Autowired // will inject reference of specific bean into below referenced variable messageService
		private MessagingService messageService;
} 

check package com.springboot.SpringBootProject.springcore.DI for example

spring bean methods


singleton scope : Single bean object instance per spring IoC container
This is the default scope for all the beans in spring 
Beans will not be created during start of server.

prototype scope : Opposite to singleton, it produces a new instance each and every time a bean is requested.
Bean will not be created during start of server.
Bean will be created every time you accessed it.


request scope :   A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of an HTTP request.
Bean will not be created during start of server.
Bean will be created every time you make http request


session scope  : A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of an HTTP Session.
Bean will not be created during start of server.
Bean will be created for every http session

Example :


//This statement is redundant - singleton is default scope
@Scope("singleton") 
@Scope("prototype")
@Scope("request")
@Scope("session")
@Scope("application")
@Scope("websocket")
@Controler or @Service or @Repository or @Component
public class BeanClass {
 
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring framework provides following below ways for controlling life cycle events of a bean:

@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations



@PostConstruct annotated method will be invoked after the bean has been constructed using default constructor 
and just before it’s instance is returned to requesting object.
@PreDestroy annotated method is called just before the bean is about be destroyed inside bean container.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interceptor :


You can use the Interceptor in Spring Boot to perform operations under the following situations −

Before sending the request to the controller

Before sending the response to the client


For example, you can use an interceptor to add the request header before sending the request to the controller and 
add the response header before sending the response to the client.


To work with interceptor, you need to create @Component class that supports it and it should implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.


preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. This method should return true to return the response to the client.

postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.

afterCompletion() method − This is used to perform operations after completing the request and response.


@Component
public class ProductServiceInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
   @Override
   public boolean preHandle(
      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
      
      return true;
   }
   @Override
   public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {}
   
   @Override
   public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception exception) throws Exception {}
}


@Component
public class ProductServiceInterceptorAppConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {
   @Autowired
   ProductServiceInterceptor productServiceInterceptor;

   @Override
   public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
      registry.addInterceptor(productServiceInterceptor);
   }
}




And in order to understand the interceptor, let's take a step back and look at the HandlerMapping. 
This maps a method to a URL, so that the DispatcherServlet will be able to invoke it when processing a request.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Global exception handling :  To handle all the exceptions inside your project at single place

To implement global exception handling  create a class  and annotate with 
@ExceptionHandler is like a catch block which catches a specific exception(Arithemic Exception)


@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
	
	@ExceptionHandler(value=Exception.class)
	public ResponseEntity<Object> catchExpetion(Exception e) {
		return new ResponseEntity<String>("all checked exceptions handdle here",HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
	}
	
	@ExceptionHandler(value=RuntimeException.class)
	public ResponseEntity<AppGenericResponse> catchExpetion(Exception e) {
		return new ResponseEntity<AppGenericResponse>("all un-checked/runtime exceptions handdle her",HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
	}
	
	@ExceptionHandler(value=FileNotException.class)
	public ResponseEntity<AppGenericResponse> catchExpetion(Exception e) {
		return new ResponseEntity<AppGenericResponse>("all un-checked/runtime exceptions handdle her",HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
	}
	
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logging :  


import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

// top of each class
Logger logger=LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);

Logging level can be one of one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF. 


//application.properties
logging.file = log
// if you want to store file in seperate location
logging.file.path = D:/AllTutorials/springboot/projects/app.log
logging.level.root=INFO
